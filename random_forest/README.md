# Random Forest training and tuning
This repository contains two scripts to train and tune a random forest model to predcit A sites in RPF reads.

#### 1. assembleTuning.R
This script prepares the pre-processed alignments for the model tuning

#### 2. tuneModel_CVpred.R
This script trains, tunes, and does basic model evaluation.

#### 3. trained_model.RData
This contains the RData object used to perform the random-forest correction to the scRibo-seq datasets.
